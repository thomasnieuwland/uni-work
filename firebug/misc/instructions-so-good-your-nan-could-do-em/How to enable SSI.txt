> sudo <text_editor> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

In the <Directory /var/www/> bit, add these two lines:

	AddType text/html .htm
	AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .htm

And at the end of the Options line, add Includes (or +Includes, if everything else on that line has a +/-)

Close text editor

> sudo a2enmod include
> sudo service apache2 restart


// What this means

When making a file that contains includes, it needs extension .htm
When making a file that is included (e.g. a snippet) it need extension .html

e.g.
	index.htm include navbarInclude.html and standard-links.html
